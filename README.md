# Supplier-Quality-Performance-Report
## Problem Scenario:
I am working with a manufacturer who receives and orders a number of raw materials which are then used in production or for general 

maintenance. Currently there is no procurement system in place and no way for the companies to validate which suppliers are providing them with 

quality goods and which are not. 

There is also no consistency between different plants and the vendors they are purchasing from. The programme management team has identified 

the need to centralize and understand supplier quality as a priority. There has been a major effort in recent weeks to consolidate the data.

The team have now managed to gather data from across the plants with information around the material, defect and vendor. 



They have also managed to get the number of defective materials and also provided a value for the minutes of downtime caused by the 

defective material. The management team are now looking for some help to visualize and extrapolate the findings from this data.



**Enterprise Manufacturers Ltd** are slowly adopting Power Bi within their organization as such one of the analysts has made an effort at starting 

to model the data. Given the importance of the project and urgency management have decided to enlist my expertise to get this over the line.

Some key questions the business want answering are:

+ Which vendors/plants are causing the greatest defect quantity?
+ Which vendors/plants are causing the greatest downtime?
+ Is there a particular combination of material and vendor that perform poorly?
+ Is there a particular combination of Vendor and plant that performs poorly?
+ How does the same vendor and material perform across different plants?
